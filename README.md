# BoredGame
#### Mid-term Skill Distillery Project
Team members and roles:

* Ashley Zink(Developer, DBA)
* Pierce Steward(Developer, Scrum Master)
* Kayalyn Edmeade(Developer)
* Bronson Spies(Developer, Repo Owner)

### Overview
For this project students were asked to create a full stack web app of their design and choosing. Our group decide to make a social media application tailored to board game fanatics. The website is able to have users create an account, create a list of their owned and favorite boardgames, and then chat in a few different areas of the site. Furthermore, users have to ability to view others profiles and see what games they have in their favorites. Users will have the ability to create events for either swapping games or to play games with each other in person. After a meet up related to playing a game users can then rate other users based off of how their experience was with the other user. For the more competitive user, their will also be an opportunity to track wins and losses and compare with others. For this sprint our team was able to accomplish everything except features related to events.

### Description

* create an account
